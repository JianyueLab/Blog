Yesterday, I let Mr. Haoran wrote two letter to postcrossing website workers which I lost my postcrossing account and I can't find Chiyoda-City in City section in the website. 
They send email to Mr. Haoran and he told me that I need sent a email to PC to discribe my problems, but I already registered a new account. So I dosn't care about it. For location, they said that they have it. Ohhh! That's true I just found! "Ichibancho (Tokyo)"

emmmmm, I think that's end.
