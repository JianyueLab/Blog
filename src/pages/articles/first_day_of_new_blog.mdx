Yesterday, I let Mr Haoran wrote two letters to Postcrossing website workers that I lost my Postcrossing account and I can't find Chiyoda City in City section in the website. 
They send email to Mr Haoran and he told me that I need to send email to PC to discribe my problems, but I already registered a new account. So I don't care. As for the location, they said they have it. Ohhh! That's right, I just found it! "Ichibancho (Tokyo)"

emmmmm, I think that's it.
